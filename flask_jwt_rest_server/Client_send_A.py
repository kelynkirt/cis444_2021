Programmer: Kaleb Newsom & Kelyn Kirt

Algorithm for Client_send_A.py

The client will have three files:
1. Unconfirmed_T_A.txt to store the unconfirmed transactions
2. Confirmed_T_A.txt to store the confirmed transactions
3. balances_A.txt

Each client has two accounts and each client account has two balances:
1. Unconfirmed_balance to store the balance after all unconfirmed transactions
2. Confirmed_balance to store the balance after all confirmed transactions.

All client balances are initialized to 1000 BC (0x000003E8).

1. Unconfirmed_balance
This is used for new transactions that have not been entered to the blockchain yet.
 For entering a new transaction:
 The payer could be one of the client's accounts.  The Payee could be one of the other client's accounts.
 At each step, provide a list of possible accounts to the user and ask them to select the accounts from the list.
 Once the user entered a new Tx, the client takes the following steps.

â€¢ When a user enters a new Tx, the client takes the following steps.
1. It checks whether {Tx_amount + Tx_fee} would not exceed the current value of Unconfirmed_balance, then reduces the
    Unconfirmed_balance by {Tx_amount + Tx_fee}.
2. It appends the Tx to a file containing its unconfirmed transactions (Unconfirmed_T. txt).
3. It sends the Tx to the full node.

The client balance file
The client stores the current values of its balances for each of its two accounts in a file named balance.txt.
The values in the files are initialized at the beginning and updated while running the program. I suggest the following
structure for the file. You are free to select another structure.
Account1:Unconfirmed_balance:Confirmed_balance
Account2:Unconfirmed_balance:Confirmed_balance
For example, for Client A, the file will be initialized as following. We store the values in HEX.
A0000001:000003E8:000003E8
A0000002:000003E8:000003E8

The client implementation
The client runs two programs:
1. Client_send.py: To send Tx to the full node.
2. Client_receive.py: To receive Tx from the full node.

-- should connect to it's full node where the node acts as a server
-- need to bind the full node program to a port number e.g., 100000 for F1.

unconfirmed transaction from client to full node will have header '000'
blockchain request from client to full node will have header '001'
